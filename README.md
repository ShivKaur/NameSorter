# NameSorter
Build a name sorter. Given a set of names, order that set first by last name, then by any given names the person may have. A name must have at least 1 given name and may have up to 3 given names.

Firstly text file with names are to be read.
After reading the content of file and putting it in an array, content can be displayed over the screen.

Then lastname of the given names are fetched

After that, lastnames are sorted, as our aim is to sort the names according to the last name.

Then the first lastname is compared with all the lastnames in the unsorted list. 
If the sorted lastname matched with the unsorted lastname list, then corresponding fullname is added to the sorted array
The same way second lastname is compared with all the lastnames in the unsorted list and so on.

Sorted Array according to lastnames will be wriiten to new text file Sorted_names_list.
